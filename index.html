    <h3>Amy  Michelle Milov: Research Informed Design</h3>
    <p> Hi Everyone, I'm Amy Milov. I'm interested in UX Research, UX Design, and Freontend Development. Im using a Mac ProBook from 2015
    </p>
    <p>I had a Godaddy hosting environment already from previous websites i designed and built. I changed my account to allow shell/ssh. I will see how it works when I upload my files. My local environment didn't work the first time I set it up, but i read in the discussion that I could try a different command to install the packages. I also had an issue where i had to change the port. Now the local environment is working. I had trouble pushing to github</p>
